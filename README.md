# Employee and Manager Salary System

This project is part of the curriculum from [App Academy Open](https://open.appacademy.io/)
where I learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), testing, and inheritance in JavaScript.

## Overview

This project implements a system to manage employees and their salaries,
including a hierarchical structure with managers and subordinates.
The main classes are `Employee` and `Manager`, with functionalities such as
calculating bonuses and dynamically adding employees to a manager's team.

## Project Structure

- `employee.js`: Contains the `Employee` class.
- `manager.js`: Contains the `Manager` class, which extends the `Employee` class.
- `test.js`: Includes test scenarios for the implemented functionalities.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

3. Run tests:
    ```bash
    npm test


## Features
- Dynamically add employees to a manager's team.
- Calculate bonuses based on salary and hierarchical team structure.
- Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming principles.
